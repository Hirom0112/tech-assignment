# ASSUMPTIONS.md — Hijack Poker Daily Streaks (Option C)

Gaps and **doc conflicts resolved by the precedence order** (CLAUDE.md §Doc precedence:
PROJECT.md > ARCHITECTURE.md > DATA_MODEL.md/API_CONTRACT.md > TECH_STACK.md > CLAUDE.md;
the official `docs/challenge-streaks.md` wins on *functional* behavior). Each entry records the
conflict, the resolution, the precedence/citation used, and the doc that must be corrected.
**Never resolve a conflict silently** — add it here and fix the losing doc (CLAUDE.md). True
blockers go in `BLOCKED.md` instead, not here.

> Seeded during slice planning (2026-06-05). The director-build session maintains this file and
> reconciles each entry into the doc it corrects during **S7** (docs pass).

## A-1 — `INTERNAL_API_SECRET` local default value

- **Conflict.** TECH_STACK.md §4 lists the dev default as `local-internal-secret`; API_CONTRACT.md §2.2 and the §8.2 curl examples use `dev-internal-secret`.
- **Resolution.** Use **`dev-internal-secret`**.
- **Precedence.** API_CONTRACT.md (precedence level 3, canonical for the wire/dev-facing contract) outranks TECH_STACK.md (level 4). CLAUDE.md Inv 7 also makes API_CONTRACT canonical for the request surface; the curl block the Unity/dev audience copies must work as written.
- **Action.** Set `INTERNAL_API_SECRET=dev-internal-secret` in `.env.example` + `docker-compose.yml` (S0); **correct TECH_STACK.md §4's value** to `dev-internal-secret` (S7).

## A-2 — Seed player-id convention vs API_CONTRACT examples

- **Conflict.** `scripts/seed-streaks.js` and DATA_MODEL.md §11 use `streak-001..streak-010`; API_CONTRACT.md §8 examples and `docs/local-development.md` use `p1-uuid-0001`.
- **Resolution.** Seed ids stay **`streak-001..streak-010`** (DATA_MODEL.md §11 explicitly says "keep the existing 10 players"). The `p1-uuid-0001` strings in API_CONTRACT.md are illustrative; any non-empty `X-Player-Id` is accepted by the stub. The dashboard's default/dev player id is a real seed id (`streak-001`).
- **Precedence.** DATA_MODEL.md (level 3) is canonical for stored data including the seed; the rewritten seed is a deliberate S5 deliverable. API_CONTRACT examples are non-normative illustrations.
- **Action.** Use `streak-001` as the live demo id in README/curl walkthroughs (S5/S7); optionally note in API_CONTRACT.md that examples are illustrative and the seed uses `streak-NNN` (S7).

## A-3 — HTTP code for an unhandled DynamoDB/database failure

- **Conflict.** ARCHITECTURE.md §7 maps "DynamoDB unavailable" to **503** `{error:"unavailable"}`; API_CONTRACT.md §3 defines **500 `InternalError`** as the unhandled server/database failure code (and lists no 503).
- **Resolution.** Unhandled DB/server failure returns **500 `InternalError`** with `{error, message}`.
- **Precedence.** CLAUDE.md Inv 7 makes API_CONTRACT.md canonical for the wire error shape **and status codes** ("status codes match API_CONTRACT.md exactly"). The §3 catalogue (400/401/403/404/409/500) is the shipped contract; ARCHITECTURE.md §7's 503 is a design-note detail that loses to the explicit wire contract.
- **Action.** Implement the S7 error-normalizing middleware against the §3 codes (500 for DB-down). **Correct ARCHITECTURE.md §7** to say 500 `InternalError` (or note 503 as a future refinement) during the S7 docs pass.

## A-4 — `serverless-esbuild` version pin is unsatisfiable

- **Conflict.** TECH_STACK.md §2 and TODO S0-1 pin `serverless-esbuild ^0.8.0`. No `0.8.x` exists on npm; that package's only `0.x` releases predate the modern esbuild peer-dep era and do not transpile `.ts` handlers for current `serverless-offline`. The requirement ("`serverless offline` runs `.ts` handlers", PLAN S0 top-risk-2) cannot be met at `^0.8.0`.
- **Resolution.** Pin **`serverless-esbuild ^1.55.0`** (installs the 1.x line; esbuild 0.28 comes in transitively). Verified by the S0 live health curl — esbuild transpiled `handler.ts` and serverless-offline served `GET /api/v1/health` → `{service:'streaks-api',status:'ok'}`.
- **Precedence.** A higher-doc *requirement* (PLAN/PROJECT: the service must build and run in TS) overrides a lower note's version literal (CLAUDE.md §Doc-precedence: "If process blocks a higher doc's requirement, the requirement wins; fix the process note afterward"). The version string is a stale literal, not a design decision.
- **Action.** **Correct TECH_STACK.md §2 and TODO S0-1** to `serverless-esbuild ^1.55.0` during the S7 docs pass.
- **Sub-note (dep budget).** Two dev-only **type** packages — `@types/jest`, `@types/express` — were added beyond the literal toolchain list. TECH_STACK §2/§3 explicitly excludes `@types/*` from the "5 new installs" budget; the 5 net installs remain typescript/ts-jest/serverless-esbuild/@types/luxon (dev) + luxon (prod). STND-5 intact.

## A-5 — serverless-offline lambda bundling + AWS creds (S1 live-gate fixes)

- **Gap (not a doc conflict).** The S1 handlers import the shared winston logger, which pulls `shared/config/logger.js` (`require('winston')`) into the esbuild bundle; esbuild could not resolve `winston` from the shared dir and the offline lambda failed to boot. After that, every DynamoDB call returned `UnrecognizedClientException` because serverless-offline overrides the process AWS creds at invocation and the offline `provider.environment` didn't declare them.
- **Resolution.** Config-only: (1) add `winston` to `custom.esbuild.exclude` in `serverless.offline.yml` + `serverless.yml` (resolves from `streaks-api/node_modules` at runtime, same pattern as the auto-external `@aws-sdk/*`); (2) declare `DYNAMODB_ENDPOINT`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION` in the offline `provider.environment` with `${env:…, default}` fallbacks so the offline lambda authoritatively points at DynamoDB Local with the literal `local`/`local` creds (Inv 12).
- **Precedence.** Most-boring, invariant-preserving option (no app-code change, no new deps). Surfaced only at S1 because S0's health route imported nothing from `shared/`; it is the TECH_STACK §3 shared-interop risk made concrete. No wire/storage change.
- **Action.** None pending — fix is in `serverless.offline.yml`/`serverless.yml`. If more handlers import other shared native deps (`ioredis`/`mysql2`/`sequelize`), add them to `exclude` too.

## A-6 — `mergePlayed` is a conditional create-or-merge, not an unconditional SET

- **Conflict.** DATA_MODEL.md §7 **pattern E** prose describes the played-merge as `SET played = :true` "no condition needed"; TODO S2-4/S2-10 require the conditional upsert `attribute_not_exists(#date) OR #played <> :true`.
- **Resolution.** Implement `mergePlayed` as the **conditional** create-or-merge (`attribute_not_exists(#date) OR #played <> :true`, `#date`/`#played` aliases, `SET` only, `if_not_exists(...)` preserving the login fields). This is what makes `playStreakUpdated` correctly report first-of-day and is the once-per-UTC-day idempotency source of truth (Inv 2).
- **Precedence.** DATA_MODEL §8's narrative already states "`attribute_not_exists(#date)`… the same primitive guards hand-completed", so the conditional form is consistent with §8; only the §7 pattern-E table row prose is loose. The binding TODO + Inv 2 win.
- **Action.** Reconcile DATA_MODEL.md §7 pattern E wording to the conditional form during the S7 docs pass.
- **Sub-note (test-infra quirk, not product):** supertest `.send(object)` hits a hoisted `mime@1.6.0` lacking `getType`; integration tests must `.set('Content-Type','application/json')` before `.send()` (done). Consider deduping `mime` in the lockfile later.

## A-7 — `rewardId` is a zero-dep time-ordered string, not `ulid`

- **Decision (resolves the carried `rewardId` note below).** The carried note said "install `ulid` only because pattern H uses `ScanIndexForward=false`". We instead use a **zero-dep, lexicographically-sortable, time-ordered** id: a 15-digit zero-padded epoch-millis prefix + a short random base-36 suffix — `${String(epochMillis(now)).padStart(15,'0')}-${rand}` (`src/services/reward.service.ts` `makeRewardId`). Epoch-millis is derived from the request's `now`/`completedAt` via `lib/utc.ts` `epochMillis` (Inv 1 — all time math stays in `utc.ts`).
- **Why zero-dep over ulid.** STND-5 caps the backend dep budget at 5 installs and it is already at 5; adding `ulid` would breach it for no functional gain. A 15-digit pad covers epoch-millis through the year ~5138, so the prefix sorts ascending by time exactly like a ULID's time component — a reward `Query` with `ScanIndexForward=false` returns newest-first **directly** (DATA_MODEL.md §7 pattern H, NFR-8 no-Scan), which is the only property pattern H requires. The random suffix disambiguates same-millisecond awards.
- **Precedence.** DATA_MODEL.md §4 *recommends* ULID but explicitly allows "an acceptable fallback" that preserves sortable-by-time ordering; this id satisfies that, so no doc conflict — the ladder/Query semantics are unchanged. Minimal-deps house style + STND-5 win over the ULID preference.
- **Action.** None pending. Reconcile the wording of DATA_MODEL.md §4 ("`rewardId` = ULID") to "sortable time-ordered id (ULID or zero-dep epoch-millis prefix)" in the S7 docs pass.

## Carried (already-documented in the docs, not conflicts — listed so they aren't re-litigated)

- **Lambda runtime skew** `nodejs20.x` (serverless.yml) vs Node 22 (docker/local) — intentional, accepted (ARCHITECTURE.md §10, TECH_STACK.md §1). Build target `ES2022`/`--target=node20`.
- **`rewardId` = ULID** was preferred for sortable rewards Query; **resolved in S3 → see A-7**: we ship the zero-dep epoch-millis-prefixed string (no `ulid` install) to keep STND-5 intact while preserving the `ScanIndexForward=false` newest-first ordering pattern H needs.
- **Zero-state `GET /player/streaks`** returns a `200` all-zeros record for any authenticated player rather than `404` (API_CONTRACT.md §4.1 canonical behavior), so the dashboard never errors on a new user.
- **Admin-grant soft cap `99`** on `freezesAvailable`; a grant that would exceed it returns `409 Conflict` — the only documented use of 409 (API_CONTRACT.md §4.7). Confirm in S4.
- **Share-card PNG** is optional; SVG is the guaranteed default. `satori`/`@resvg/resvg-js` stay opt-in and only count against the dep budget if PNG is actually built (TECH_STACK.md §2, S9).
